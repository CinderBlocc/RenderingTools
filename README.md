# RenderingTools
A collection of rendering tools and objects for BakkesMod CanvasWrapper drawing in Rocket League

*NOTE: This collection has been built over the course of a year while I was learning C++ and linear algebra. Many of the functions contained within this library are very inefficient, or the code style may be inconsistent. As I continue to learn both C++ and linear algebra, I will update these functions to be more accurate and efficient.* ***Your code may break between versions.***
